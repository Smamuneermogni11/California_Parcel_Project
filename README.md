# Parcel Project in GIS using CRISP DM Model
This repository contains code and documentation for a parcel project in GIS using the CRISP DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) model. The project aims to use GIS technology to analyze parcel data and provide insights on land use, land value, and property taxation.

## Project Overview
The project follows the CRISP DM model, which consists of the following six phases:

Business Understanding
Data Understanding
Data Preparation
Modeling
Evaluation
Deployment
Business Understanding

In this phase, we identify the business objectives and define the problem statement. The objective of this project is to provide insights on land use, land value, and property taxation using parcel data. The problem statement is to analyze parcel data using GIS technology to identify patterns and trends in land use and value.

### Data Understanding
In this phase, we gather and understand the data that will be used for analysis. The data used for this project includes parcel data, which contains information on land use, property value, and tax assessments. The data is obtained from local government agencies and is in the form of shapefiles and CSV files.

### Data Preparation
In this phase, we clean and preprocess the data for analysis. The data is first imported into a GIS software and geocoded to obtain spatial data. The data is then cleaned and filtered to remove any irrelevant or incomplete records. The data is also transformed and normalized to ensure consistency and accuracy in the analysis.

### Modeling
In this phase, we develop a model to analyze the data and provide insights. The model used for this project is a spatial analysis model that uses GIS technology to identify patterns and trends in land use and value. The model is developed using Python and the ArcPy library, which provides access to GIS functionality.

### Evaluation
In this phase, we evaluate the model and its results. The model is evaluated based on its accuracy, completeness, and relevance to the business objectives. The results of the analysis are also evaluated to ensure that they are actionable and provide meaningful insights.

#### Deployment
In this phase, we deploy the model and its results to stakeholders. The results are presented in the form of maps, charts, and reports. The stakeholders can use the results to make informed decisions on land use, property value, and tax assessments.

### Getting Started
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following:

GIS software, such as ArcGIS or QGIS
Python 3.x
ArcPy library
Once you have installed the required software and libraries, you can clone this repository and run the code in a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
